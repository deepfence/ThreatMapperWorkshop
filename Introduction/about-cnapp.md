## Why Industry needs CNAPP 

- Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) is a new category of security solutions that are designed to protect cloud-native applications and workloads running on containers, serverless, and Kubernetes.

- Multi Cloud Adoption is increasing and so is the need for a single platform to manage security across multiple cloud providers.

Solution: CNAPP provides a single platform to manage security across multiple cloud providers.

- Lack of Visibility: Cloud services are often managed by the cloud provider, leading to limited visibility into the underlying infrastructure. This can make it hard to track and assess potential risks.

Solution: Implement logging and monitoring solutions that provide insights into user activity, resource interactions, and security events. Consider third-party security solutions that offer additional visibility. 

- Detect Early: fix issues in pipeline than many security tools . CNAPP give more visibility into cloud worlodad , Container and Kubernetes, Security teams can identify misconfiguration and compliances in runtime and fix it before production. 

- Connect Cloud Security to DevOps: CNAPP is integrated into continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) pipelines, where it automatically and continuously scans development and production environments for vulnerabilities and threats throughout the entire lifecycle process. With a CNAPP, risk detection and compliance are automated, giving security teams a reduced workload so they can can focus on expanding their cloud infrastructure while strengthening security simultaneously.

- Integration - Altert and Notification: CNAPP can be integrated with SIEM and other security tools to provide alert and notification.
